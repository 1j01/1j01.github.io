This is my website. [Go ahead, go to it.](http://1j01.github.io)

I link to everything as [1j01.github.io](http://1j01.github.io) in case the domain expires or whatever.

That's another link to [1j01.github.io](http://1j01.github.io) by the way.

Have you gone to [1j01.github.io](http://1j01.github.io) yet?

Or [IsaiahOdhner.ml](http://IsaiahOdhner.ml)?
