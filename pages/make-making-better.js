					I want to <strong>improve creative software</strong>.
					I have a lot of ideas about how to do this.

				<p>
					I'll be writing a manifesto, which I'll put here, or at least link to it (maybe I'll put it on Medium?).
					I also plan on starting a Patreon page.
					For now you can follow me on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/isaiahodhner">@isaiahodhner</a>.
